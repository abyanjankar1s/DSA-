# Count Number of Islands
# Given a 2D grid grid where '1' represents land and '0' represents water, count and return the number of islands.

# An island is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically and is surrounded by water. You may assume water is surrounding the grid (i.e., all the edges are water).

# Example 1:

# Input: grid = [
#     ["0","1","1","1","0"],
#     ["0","1","0","1","0"],
#     ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#     ["0","0","0","0","0"]
#   ]
# Output: 1
