# Climbing Stairs
# You are given an integer n representing the number of steps to reach the top of a staircase. You can climb with either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

# Return the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of the staircase.

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 2

# Output: 2
# Explanation:

# 1 + 1 = 2
# 2 = 2


class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        one, two = 1, 1 

        for i in range(n-1):
            temp = one 
            one = one + two 
            two = temp 
        return one
