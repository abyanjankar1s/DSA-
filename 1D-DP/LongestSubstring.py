# Longest Increasing Subsequence
# Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

# A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

# For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt".
# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]

# Output: 4
