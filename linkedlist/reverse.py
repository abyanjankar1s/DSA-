# Reverse a Linked List
# Given the beginning of a singly linked list head, reverse the list, and return the new beginning of the list.

# Example 1:

# Input: head = [0,1,2,3]

# Output: [3,2,1,0]

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        curr, prev = head, None 
        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr 
            curr = temp 
        return prev
